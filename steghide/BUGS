* The steghide package for Windows contains a version of libmcrypt that has a
  broken implementation of the blowfish algorithm that is not compatible to
  the blowfish implementation in libmcrypt versions 2.4.9 and higher. That
  means that somebody with a newer libmcrypt version than 2.4.9 is not able
  to extract something that has been embedded by somebody with an older version
  than 2.4.9 and vice versa. If no encryption has been used (with -H -E as
  arguments) this does not apply.

* The configure script has been done a bit lazy. Those parts of steghide that
  need a certain library should not compile if the configure script has
  determined that this library is not available.

If you find a bug, please send a mail to the steghide development mailing list:
steghide-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
