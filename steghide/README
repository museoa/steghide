Introduction :
==============

Steghide is a steganography program that is able to hide data in various kinds
of image- and audio-files. The color- respectivly sample-frequencies are not
changed thus making the embedding resistant against first-order statistical
tests.

The current version of steghide is 0.5.1

Features:
*) compression of embedded data
*) encryption of embedded data
*) embedding of a checksum to verify the integrity of the extraced data
*) support for JPEG, BMP, WAV and AU files

Steganography :
===============

Steganography literally means covered writing. Its goal is to hide the fact
that communication is taking place. This is often achieved by using a (rather
large) cover file and embedding the (rather short) secret message into this
file. The result is a innocuous looking file (the stego file) that contains
the secret message.

Compilation and Installation :
==============================

Dependencies :
--------------
You should have the following libraries installed to use steghide.

* libmhash
  A library that provides various hash algorithms and cryptographic key
  generation algorithms. Steghide needs this library to convert a passphrase
  into a form that can be used as input for cryptographic and steganographic
  algorithms.
  Available at: http://mhash.sourceforge.net/

* libmcrypt  
  A library that provides a lot of symmetric encryption algorithms. If you
  compile steghide without libmcrypt you will not be able to use steghide to
  encrypt data before embedding nor to extract encrypted data (even if you know
  the correct passphrase).
  Available at: http://mcrypt.hellug.gr/

* libjpeg
  A library implementing jpeg image compression. Without this library you will
  not be able to embed data in jpeg files nor to extract data from jpeg files.
  Available at: http://www.ijg.org/

* zlib
  A lossless data compression library. If you compile steghide without having
  this library installed you will not be able to use steghide to compress data
  before embedding nor to extract compressed data from a stego-file.
  Available at: http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

Libmhash is absolutly required to compile steghide. While you can compile it
without the other libraries they are highly recommended as major functionality
will not be available without them.

Linux / Unix :
--------------
After unpacking the source distribution, enter the following commands:

1) ./configure 
2) make
3) make check
4) make install (as root)

For more information see the generic installation instructions in the file
INSTALL that came with the distribution.

If any of these commands fails, please send a mail to the steghide development
mailing list (steghide-devel@lists.sourceforge.net) describing the error.
 
Windows :
---------
The easiest way is to download the precompiled binary (including Windows
versions of the necessary libraries) from the steghide website at:
http://steghide.sourceforge.net/index.php

If you want to compile the sources yourself you need a C++ compiler. How you
need to compile the source code depends on the compiler you are using: Please
consult your compiler's documentation.

Steghide can be compiled with gcc in the cygwin environment
(http://www.cygwin.com/) which is a unix emulation layer for Windows using the
procedure mentioned above for the Linux/Unix compilation.

Quick-Start :
=============

Here are some examples how steghide can be used. Take a look at these to receive
a first impression. If you want more detailed information please read the
manpage.

The basic usage is as follows:

  $ steghide embed -cf picture.jpg -ef secret.txt
  Enter passhrase:
  Re-Enter passphrase:

This command will embed the file secret.txt in the cover-file picture.jpg.
After that you can send picture.jpg to the designated receiver of the secret
message. The Receiver has to call steghide in the following way:

  $ steghide extract -sf picture.jpg
  Enter passphrase:

If the supplied passphrase is correct, the contents of the original file
secret.txt will be extracted from the stego-file picture.jpg and saved under
the same file name in the current directory.






To embed the file secret.txt in the jpeg file cvr.jpg and save the resulting
stego file as stg.jpg type:

  $ steghide embed -pf secret.txt -cf cvr.jpg -sf stg.jpg
  Enter passhrase:
  Re-Enter passphrase:

To extract this data again type:

  $ steghide extract -sf stg.jpg
  Enter passphrase:
  writing plain file to "secret.txt".

When embedding data, the name of the original plain file is embedded too: The
extract command above will create a file secret.txt in the current directory
and write the embedded data to secret.txt.

You can override the embedded plain file name if you specify a -pf argument
when extracting. The following command will put the embedded data into the file
plain.txt:

  $ steghide extract -sf stg.jpg -pf plain.txt
  Enter passphrase:
  writing plain file to "plain.txt".

If you are using a system that supports pipes you can pass data via
standard input to steghide. In the following example data is compressed before
it is (encrypted and) embedded:

  $ gzip -c pln.txt | steghide embed -cf cvr.bmp -sf stg.bmp -pf - -p "This is a passphrase."

To extract (and view) the data from this file again, you could do something
like this:

  $ steghide extract -sf stg.bmp -pf - -p "This is a passphrase." | gunzip | less

If you pass data to steghide via standard input or from steghide to another
program via standard output, you need to specify the passphrase on the command
line with the -p argument (as shown in the two commands above).
