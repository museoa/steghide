These are things that I plan to implement in the future:
(in no particular order)

* compress plain data before embedding (zlib)

* preserve color/sample frequencies to prevent detection by color frequency
  based statistical tests

* support for other file formats (gif, mp3, avi, png)

* gui frontend

* user's guide (sgml?, gnu texinfo?)

* support for RLE-encoded bmps

* support for jpegs that use progressive DCT

* matrix encoding

* allow PGP encryption of embedded data (gpgme?)
