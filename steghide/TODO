These are things that I plan to implement in the future:

* gui frontend

* user-friendly installer for Windows version (InnoSetup)

* use libaudiofile for audio file format support

* make embedding data in audio cds possible (embed markers for synchronization)

* rewrite memory management such that cover-/stego-file must no longer be kept in memory as a whole

* support for other file formats (mp3, png, gif, avi)

* user's guide (sgml?, gnu texinfo?)

* support for RLE-encoded bmps

* matrix encoding

? support for spreading one secret file into a set of >= 1 cover files

? support for embedding more than one message into one cover file (different passphrases)

? allow PGP encryption of embedded data (gpgme?)
